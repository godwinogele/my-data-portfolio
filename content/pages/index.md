        title: YouTube Channel Data Scraping Project
        text: >
          In this project, I utilized a no-code web scraper to extract data from
          a YouTube channel. The scraping process captured key metrics,
          including video durations, number of views for regular videos, and
          views for Shorts. This data analysis provided valuable insights into
          audience engagement and content performance, helping to identify
          trends and inform future content strategies.

        title: Data Cleaning with Excel
        text: >
          This project involved cleaning and preparing a large dataset in Excel.
          I tackled data quality issues such as missing values, formatting
          inconsistencies, and outliers. By using Excel’s functions and data
          validation tools, I ensured the dataset was structured and ready for
          further analysis. This cleaned data set became the foundation for
          accurate decision-making and analysis.
